# readNum
This python project turns a number into a readable spelled-out form

You just have to download [readNum.py file](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/readNum/blob/main/readNum.py)  
And then you can get going. Drop any value into the `readNum`-function
```python
from readNum import readNum
assert readNum(1) == "one"
```

So if you put in a value the function will return that value as a `str`.  
You can find more examples in [showcase.py](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/readNum/blob/main/showcase.py).
