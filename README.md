# readNum
This python project turns a number into a readable spelled-out form

You just have to download the [readNum.py file](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/readNum/blob/main/readNum.py)  
and then do `import readNum` or `import readNum from readNum` in the file you need this module.  
And then you can get going. Drop any value into the `readNum`-function
For Example:  
`import readNum`  
`myNumber=1`  
`readNumber(myNumber)`  

This will return you "one"  
So if you put in a value the function will return you that value as a String.  
Only if you give the function a sequence (data structure) then it will return a processed list for you.  
This module will not clog your print output because it does not print anything.

You can find more examples in the [showcase.py file](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/readNum/blob/main/showcase.py).
